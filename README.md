# Thermal Cracking Overview
Thermal Cracking is a process that uses heat and pressure to break down long-chained, higher-boiling hydrocarbons in crude oil to short-chained, lower-boiling hydrocarbons.

# Thermal Cracking Typical Conditions
Temperature: 455-540 C (850-1005 F), Pressure: 100-1000 psi  

Mild Conditions: higher yields of gasoline components, decreased gas production, decreased coke production (lower quality gasoline)
Severe Conditions: higher gas production, increased coke production, decreased yields of gasoline (higher quality gasoline)  

Higher temperatures increases the speed of conversions. However, this may change a reactionâ€™s chemistry and does not necessary lead to higher target product yields.

# Benefits Of Thermal Cracking
Enables low operating pressure and high operating temperature  
Reduces the need for an expensive catalyst  
High yield of alkenes (e.g. ethene)

# Disadvantages Of Thermal Cracking
Conditions can be difficult and expensive to maintain  
Potential for corrosion and metal dusting due to surfaces being in contact with hydrocarbons at high temperatures  
External fuel needed for heating is costly  
Large amounts of waste/undesired products (e.g. coke)

# Importance Of Thermal Cracking 
Thermal cracking produces ethene. Ethene can be polymerized to produce polyethylene plastics  
Cracking is an important process for diesel fuel & commercial gasoline  
low demand long-chained hydrocarbons are broken down into higher demand short-chained hydrocarbons

# Ways To Improve Thermal Cracking
Oxide protective layer on equipment to prevent metal dusting on equipment can decrease replacement costs  
Use of solvents with hydrogen transfer properties to reduce coke formation  
Coupon monitoring and acoustic monitoring preventive measures to detect corrosion
