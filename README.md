# Ethylene Production Via Cracking & Metal Dusting
This is an overview of how ethylene is produced via thermal cracking and a summary of the different mechanisms and mitigation techniques of metal dusting.

# Thermal Cracking Overview
Thermal Cracking is a process that uses heat and pressure to break down long-chained, higher-boiling hydrocarbons in crude oil to short-chained, lower-boiling hydrocarbons.

# Thermal Cracking Typical Conditions
Temperature: 455-540 C (850-1005 F), Pressure: 100-1000 psi  

Mild Conditions: higher yields of gasoline components, decreased gas production, decreased coke production (lower quality gasoline)
Severe Conditions: higher gas production, increased coke production, decreased yields of gasoline (higher quality gasoline)  

Higher temperatures increases the speed of conversions. However, this may change a reactionâ€™s chemistry and does not necessary lead to higher target product yields.

# Benefits Of Thermal Cracking
Enables low operating pressure and high operating temperature  
Reduces the need for an expensive catalyst  
High yield of alkenes (e.g. ethene)

# Disadvantages Of Thermal Cracking
Conditions can be difficult and expensive to maintain  
Potential for corrosion and metal dusting due to surfaces being in contact with hydrocarbons at high temperatures  
External fuel needed for heating is costly  
Large amounts of waste/undesired products (e.g. coke)

# Importance Of Thermal Cracking 
Thermal cracking produces ethene. Ethene can be polymerized to produce polyethylene plastics  
Cracking is an important process for diesel fuel & commercial gasoline  
low demand long-chained hydrocarbons are broken down into higher demand short-chained hydrocarbons

# Ways To Improve Thermal Cracking
Oxide protective layer on equipment to prevent metal dusting on equipment can decrease replacement costs  
Use of solvents with hydrogen transfer properties to reduce coke formation  
Coupon monitoring and acoustic monitoring preventive measures to detect corrosion

# Metal Dusting 
Metal Dusting is the corrosion of metallic materials into dust (fine metal particles) in a carbon-saturated atmosphere due to rapid carburization.

This is a prominent issue in syngas, hydrogen, and ammonia production.  
Oil cracking are facilities susceptible to metal dusting.

Fe, Co, Ni base alloys are affected. 
Specific metal dusting mechanisms differ depending on the type of alloy and phase.
Analysis must be done to find the best mitigation procedures.

# Metal Dusting Mitigation Techniques

Coatings:  
Thermal spray coatings can be a physical barrier to carbon but can be less effective depending in porosity  
Aluminizing is the usage of an aluminum surface treatment to improve thermal corrosion resistance and can be effective around 1095C  
Oxide scales slow carbon diffusion and prevents carbon accumulation  
Surface finish may prevent the initiation of metal dusting but results are still inconclusive 

Alloy Element Addition:  
Chrome helps form oxide scale but can have negative effects in low allow steel, may encourage the formation of nucleation sites in cementite layer  
Alloys with carbide-forming elements (Ti, Nb, Mo) initially degrade less but after corrosion starts metal wastage is severe  
Columbium could reduce the rate of carburization in parent material  
Silicon can make alloys more metal dusting resistant  
Nickel generally beneficial but negative effects in sulfur environment  
Copper in a Cu-base Ni-containing alloy heals the protective oxide scale


Operating Envelop:  
Additions of sulfur is used in cracking during ethylene production to prevent metal dusting. Sulfur slows the nucleation of graphite and stabilizes metastable carbides  
Ethylene presence had been found to increase carbon formation rate  
Increasing exposure temperature causes more oxide formation which reduces carbon deposition
