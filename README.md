# Ethylene Production Via Cracking
This is an overview of how ethylene is produced via thermal cracking.

# Process Summary
![Process_Summary](/Diagrams/Process_Summary.png)
Here is a general overview of the steps in ethylene production. Through this process, ethene and propene can be produced from crude oil. At the end of production, ethene and propene are drawn out while remaining ethane and propane are recycled back into the cracking furnace. 

# Thermal Cracking Overview
Thermal Cracking is a process that uses heat and pressure to break down long-chained, higher-boiling hydrocarbons in crude oil to short-chained, lower-boiling hydrocarbons. 
![Thermal_Cracking_Chemical_Reaction](/Diagrams/Thermal_Cracking_Chemical_Reaction.png)  
Here is an example of the breaking down of hydrocarbons that takes place during thermal cracking. Heptane is placed under high temperatures and through the thermal cracking process breaks down into two smaller hydrocarbons (ethene and pentane).

Thermal cracking breaks alkanes down into an alkene/olefin and a shorter-chained alkane. Alkenes/olefins contain a carbon-carbon double bond. The length of the alkane depends on the type of cracking. Longer alkanes typically burn more evenly as fuels. Thus, the type of thermal cracking and its conditions can change depending on what products are desired. 

# Thermal Cracking Typical Conditions
Temperature: 455-540 C (850-1005 F), Pressure: 100-1000 psi  

Mild Conditions: higher yields of gasoline components, decreased gas production, decreased coke production (lower quality gasoline)
Severe Conditions: higher gas production, increased coke production, decreased yields of gasoline (higher quality gasoline)  

Higher temperatures increases the speed of conversions. However, this may change a reactionâ€™s chemistry and does not necessary lead to higher target product yields. 

# Quenching

After thermal cracking comes quenching. Quenching helps to cool the products of thermal cracking. The purpose of quenching is to prevent further reactions in order to mitigate the formation of unwanted byproducts that can happen with continued decomposition of thermal cracking products.

# Benefits Of Thermal Cracking
Enables low operating pressure and high operating temperature  
Reduces the need for an expensive catalyst  
High yield of alkenes (e.g. ethene)

# Disadvantages Of Thermal Cracking
Conditions can be difficult and expensive to maintain  
Potential for corrosion and metal dusting due to surfaces being in contact with hydrocarbons at high temperatures  
External fuel needed for heating is costly  
Large amounts of waste/undesired products (e.g. coke)

# Importance Of Thermal Cracking 
Thermal cracking produces ethene. Ethene can be polymerized to produce polyethylene plastics  
Cracking is an important process for diesel fuel & commercial gasoline  
low demand long-chained hydrocarbons are broken down into higher demand short-chained hydrocarbons

# Ways To Improve Thermal Cracking
Oxide protective layer on equipment to prevent metal dusting on equipment can decrease replacement costs  
Use of solvents with hydrogen transfer properties to reduce coke formation  
Coupon monitoring and acoustic monitoring preventive measures to detect corrosion
